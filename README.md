**VERY IMPORTANT**
After I made the presentation of the game, I also ADDED A TIMER ON THE SCREEN TO TELL HOW MANY SECONDS HAVE THE PLAYER BEEN ALIVE FOR, this is
basically the score of the player.

I made this project as a part of course work under ES102. 

For the project, I made a game using the pygame library

For the game to work, we need to install pygame by running:

pip install pygame

in the command prompt in a windows machine

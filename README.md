PROJECT BY SANSKAR SHARMA
ROLL NUMBER-20110185
BRANCH-ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING

With this dataset, I would like to answer the following questions that came up in my mind:

1)What field is receiving the maximum funding amount by investors?

2)Which firms are investing the most in indian startups? Do the fund more startups or are they really specific with the process?

3)Which Indian startup received maximum funding amount?

4)Which Indian startup received funding amount 

5)What do these numbers indicate for the next-gen indian startups?

I would use numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries in python. I would answer the above questions in the most visual manner as possible. Therefore I would 
be using graphs, charts and animations.

This project is really special to me as I am also aspiring to be a young enterprenuer after/during college. These predictions can hepl the aspiring 
enterprenuers to make wise decisions and invest their energy accordingly.

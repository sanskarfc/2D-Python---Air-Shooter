# ES102-Project-20110185

PROJECT BY SANSKAR SHARMA
ROLL NUMBER-20110185
BRANCH-ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING


I made this project as a part of course work under ES102. 

For the project, I made a game using the pygame, random and time library

The images are copyright free and are downloaded from flaticon.com. 

For the game to work, we need to install pygame by running:

pip install pygame

in the command prompt in a windows machine

When I used the images for the project, I had to specifiy the path on my machine. 

for eg: (r'C:\Users\sansk\Desktop\Fly.png')
